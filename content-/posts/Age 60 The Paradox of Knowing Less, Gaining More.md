**What I have learned in my 60 years of life is that I know less than I did when I was 24.**

As I hit the age of 60, I found myself pondering why I seem to know less than I did when I was 24. Had I truly spent the past 46 years forgetting everything I had learned? However, looking on the brighter side, I have gained emotional resilience; I'm much less likely to feel offended and find myself in a state of enhanced calm. Maybe I was filled with irrelevant knowledge earlier. 

Thankfully, I leaned that most of this does not matter much.

There should be some rules:
- Is it really worth fighting about?
  - Most issues are the other person's problem, not yours.

- Will this mean anything in 5 years?
  - Most issues are not worth the time and effort.

- Is this a life or death issue?
  - Only respond this is a matter of life death or harm for those you care about.

- Is this a moral issue?
  - then whose morals are you arguing about?
