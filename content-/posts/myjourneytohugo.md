## Hugo Go: My Ultimate Go-To.

For most small websites there is nothing better than Hugo Go. It is fast, easy to use, and can save you a lot of money. 

As a developer I have been using Hugo Go for a while now, and I have to say it is the best static site generator I have ever used..

The main benefit that using Hugo Jamstack is massive cost savings on hosting, and development time. This has help me to reduce my cost to customers, and increase my profit margins.

You can quickly realise the benefits of cost savings technical downtime and fixing issues like plugin issues and database corruption or injection attacks that cost hours and day to fix plus the cost of the developer to fix the issue.


Many ISP' charge a healthy budget for a reasonably shared server.  I have experience that when the website response was slow the ISP suggested thaI I upgrade to the next level for more performance.


I have been using Hugo Go for a while now, and I have to say iit very fast on low cost hosting platforms, and easy to maintain.

My clients benefit from ZERO downtime in the past 18months, compared to a Wordpress site that I had to maintain for a client that was hacked and had to be restored from a backup.  The site was down for 3 days, and the client was not happy.   Another occasion other a plugin update cause the database to have issues which took nearly a month to diagnose, pluse we had to bu a new premium plugin to replace the functionally of the corrupted plugin.

Hugo Go is a much happier experince all around.


### But static web sites are old fashioned and boring.
Sorry but no, static websites are the future.  They are fast, secure, and easy to maintain.  They are also very cost effective to host, and maintain.  They are also very easy to scale up and down as needed.

They had excellent Javascript and API support, and can be used to build very complex websites.  They are also very easy to maintain and update.

So, the time a  WordPress developer calls you to offer you a new website, ask them if they can build it in Hugo Go.  If they say no, just hang up the phone and call me.  I will build you a website that will be fast, secure, and easy to maintain.  It will also be very cost effective to host, and maintain.  It will also be very easy to scale up and down as needed.
