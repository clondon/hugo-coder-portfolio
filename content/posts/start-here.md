## Welcome to my world

I am an IT Security software engineer with a passion for building things. I have a background in music and programming.
I am currently working as an IT Security Analyst in the UK.
My research interests are in the areas of AI LLM and automation, computer vision, and robotics.  I am particularly interested in developing algorithms that can learn from experience and adapt to new environments. 

I am excited and fearful about the AI resolution, we are living in interesting times.

I hope to connect with anyone with similar interests
