As I hit the age of 60, I found myself pondering why I seem to know less than I did when I was 24. Had I truly spent the past 46 years forgetting everything I had learned? However, looking on the brighter side, I have gained emotional resilience; I'm much less likely to feel offended and find myself in a state of enhanced calm. Maybe I was filled with irrelevant knowledge earlier. Thankfully, most of it has been cleared from my mind now.
